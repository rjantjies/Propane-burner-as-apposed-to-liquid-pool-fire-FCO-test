# Propane-burner-as-oppposed-to-a liquid-pool-fire-FCO-test
## Introduction  
Fast cook-off (FCO) is a standard safety test that must be enforced globally on all munitions. [Traditionally fast cook-off tests would be conducted using liquid-fuel-pool-fires](https://www.sto.nato.int/publications/STO%20Educational%20Notes/STO-EN-AVT-214/EN-AVT-214-02.pdf) to assess the vulnerability or rather sensitivity of munitions. However, in recent years the focus has been shifted to find alternative methods to conduct fast cook-off tests as opposed to the one currently employed. Initially only proposed as a substitute, propane burners have already proved to be [safer, inexpensive and more environmentally friendly](https://ndiastorage.blob.core.usgovcloudapi.net/ndia/2018/imem/20118_Washburn_Paper.pdf) when compared to the liquid-fuel-pool-fires.  
  
  ## Propane as an appropriate substitute to liquid-fuel for conducting FCO tests  
  ### Environmental concerns
  Ordinarily large amounts of hydrocarbon fuel (JP-5, JP-8, kerosene, etc.) would be burned during a typical FCO test which often led to the release of large amounts of harmful emissions into the environment, but with the world becoming more eco-conscious an alternative had to be found. Relative to everyday hydrocarbon fuels propane burns cleaner thus it does not negatively harm the environment as much.  
    
   ### [Thermal requirements](https://ndiastorage.blob.core.usgovcloudapi.net/ndia/2013/IMEM/T16204_Scholtes.pdf)  
   To ensure propane is indeed a suitable substitute it must also meet several criteria which to some extent guarantees that it will produce similar heating conditions as with a liquid hydrocarbon fuel. The criteria below are set out in STANAG 4240 and must normally be verified by testing:  
   * The heat load to the test item must match what would be achieved from a liquid hydrocarbon fuel fire.  
   * The average temperature should be greater than 800Â°C while the measured heat flux should be greater than 80 kW/m2 
   * The heating must be uniform such that the standard deviation of the local temperature does not deviate by more than 10% of the overall average temperature.
   * The munition test item must be engulfed by the flames.
   * The heating must roughly be 90% radiation.  
   * The heating duration at minimal should be 150% of the estimated test time.  
     
     ## Cost analysis
   To compare the costs associated with fast cook-off testing a cost analysis was performed on both the propane burner and the liquid-fuel-pool-fire. The operating cost associated with the propane burner is based off burners used at Dahlgren. Using a similar approach, a cost model can be applied which include the following divisions:  
   - Nonrecurring costs  
   - Per-test cost of daily operations
   - Annualized recurring costs
