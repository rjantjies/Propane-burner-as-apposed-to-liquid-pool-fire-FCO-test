# Propane-burner-as-oppposed-to-a liquid-pool-fire-FCO-test
## Introduction  
Fast cook-off is a standard safety test that must be enforced globally on all munitions. [Traditionally fast cook-off tests would be conducted using liquid-fuel-pool-fires](https://www.sto.nato.int/publications/STO%20Educational%20Notes/STO-EN-AVT-214/EN-AVT-214-02.pdf) to assess the vulnerability or rather sensitivity of munitions. However, in recent years the focus has been shifted to find alternative methods to conduct fast cook-off tests as opposed to the one currently employed. Initially only proposed as a substitute, propane burners have already proved to be [safer, inexpensive and more environmentally friendly](https://ndiastorage.blob.core.usgovcloudapi.net/ndia/2018/imem/20118_Washburn_Paper.pdf) when compared to the liquid-fuel-pool-fires.
