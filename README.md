# Propane-burner-as-oppposed-to-a liquid-pool-fire-FCO-test
## Introduction  
Fast cook-off is a standard safety test that must be enforced globally on all munitions. Traditionally fast cook-off tests would be conducted using liquid-fuel-pool-fires to assess the vulnerability or rather sensitivity of munitions. However, in recent years the focus has been shifted to find alternative methods to conduct fast cook-off tests as opposed to the one currently employed. Initially only proposed as a substitute, propane burners have already proved to be safer, inexpensive and more environmentally friendly when compared to the liquid-fuel-pool-fires.
