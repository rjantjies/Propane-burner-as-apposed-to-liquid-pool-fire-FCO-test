# Propane-burner-as-oppposed-to-a liquid-pool-fire-FCO-test
## Introduction  
Fast cook-off (FCO) is a standard safety test that must be enforced globally as part of the Insensitive Munition (IM) evaluation on all munitions as required by STANAG 4439. [Traditionally fast cook-off tests would be conducted using liquid-fuel-pool-fires](https://www.sto.nato.int/publications/STO%20Educational%20Notes/STO-EN-AVT-214/EN-AVT-214-02.pdf) to assess the vulnerability or rather the sensitivity of munitions. However, in recent years the focus has been shifted to find alternative methods to conduct fast cook-off tests as opposed to the one currently employed. Initially only proposed as a substitute, propane burners have already proved to be [safer, inexpensive and more environmentally friendly](https://ndiastorage.blob.core.usgovcloudapi.net/ndia/2018/imem/20118_Washburn_Paper.pdf) when compared to the liquid-fuel-pool-fires.  
  
  ## Propane as an appropriate substitute to liquid-fuel for conducting FCO tests
Propane together with natural gas, butane and hexane were proposed as an alternative fuel source for a FCO burner. During the development of this technology it was recognized that propane had several characteristics that made it the obvious choice of fuel for the development of a FCO burner. Compared to natural gas, butane and hexane, propane is readily available and can be delivered quite easily. Due to its availability, propane is relatively inexpensive and its price is comparable to typical hydrocarbon liquid-fuels. At atmospheric conditions propane can be stored as a liquid which is beneficial as it allows for the storage of a large amount of fuel in a relatively small tank. Its saturation pressure at this temperature is high enough such that the need for pumps is eliminated. Relative to everyday hydrocarbon liquid-fuels propane burns much cleaner thus it does not negatively harm the environment as much.  
  
   ## FCO test requirements
   To ensure propane is indeed a suitable substitute it must also meet several criteria which to some extent guarantees that it will produce similar heating conditions as with a liquid hydrocarbon fuel. The criteria below are set out in STANAG 4240 and must normally be verified by means of extensive testing:  
   1. Test hearth size  
   The region within the fire where the thermal (both temperature and heat flux) requirements are met is referred to as the hearth. Preferentially the hearth should be designed such that the test item is completely engulfed by flames, but still large enough to allow sufficient clearance on each side of the test item. To ensure the test item is completely engulfed by the flames it must be centered within the hearth area.  
   
   2. Test hearth  
   Using external thermocouples which are placed at prefixed locations an average flame temperature of 800°C must be measured for the test to be considered valid.
     
   3. Test environment  
   It is recommended that the test not be conducted in the rain as it could lead to localized heating irregularities which may affect the outcome of the test. Also, FCO test using a burner should specofcally not be conducted with high wind velocities as it will prevent the test item from being fully engulfed by flames.
     
   4. Test timing  
   Timing on the test item reaction starts the instant all valid thermocouples reach 550°C. Once all thermocouples have reach this temperature it can be assumed with confidence that the flames has indeed completely engulfed the test item.
    
   ## FCO test requirements
   To ensure propane is indeed a suitable substitute it must also meet several criteria which to some extent guarantees that it will produce similar heating conditions as with a liquid hydrocarbon fuel. The criteria below are set out in STANAG 4240 and must normally be verified by testing:  
   * The heat load to the test item must match what would be achieved from a liquid hydrocarbon fuel fire.  
   * The average temperature should be greater than 800°C while the measured heat flux should be greater than 80 kW/m2 
   * The heating must be uniform such that the standard deviation of the local temperature does not deviate by more than 10% of the overall average temperature.
   * The munition test item must be engulfed by the flames.
   * The heating must roughly be 90% radiation.  
   * The heating duration at minimal should be 150% of the estimated test time.  
     
     ## Cost analysis
   To compare the costs associated with fast cook-off testing a cost analysis was performed on both the propane burner and the liquid-fuel-pool-fire. The operating cost associated with the propane burner is based off burners used at Dahlgren. Using a similar approach, a cost model can be applied which include the following divisions:  
   - Nonrecurring costs  
   - Per-test cost of daily operations
   - Annualized recurring costs  
     
     ### Nonrecurring costs
     Non-recurring costs refers to the one-time cost associated with acquiring a propane burner. Generally, it also includes the engineering costs to design the burner. To build a propane burner manufacturing and construction costs have to considered. Calibrating and certifying a propane burner once fully developed can also be seen as a nonrecurring cost. Whilst each of these are equally as important as the other, the major contributor to nonrecurring cost is the labour required to fabricate and assemble the test facility.  
     #### Engineering costs 
     Using readily available materials which are inexpensive a 3.7 m x 3.7 m propane burner was assembled at Dahlgren. 
     #### Manufacturing and construction costs  
     #### Fuel delivery and control system costs  
     #### Calibration costs
       
       ### Per-test costs
      The per-test costs include all the recurring costs that are to be repeated for each test performed. The per-test costs incorporate the requirements and documentation, all pre-test preparations and fabrication, the labour involved in test execution, all post-test activities, material surcharges and non-labour costs.  
        
        ### Annualized recurring costs
        The annualized costs include all the recurring costs that are not directly linked to test execution. Generally these recurring costs would comprise of regular maintenance to the system as well as costs associated with maintaining regulatory and safety compliances.
